# My generative art and creative coding journey

This repository is a collection of my personal experimentations within the world of generative art. The sketches have been produced with [p5.js](https://github.com/processing/p5.js), a Javascript client-side library for creating graphic and interactive experiences, based on the core principles of [Processing](https://github.com/processing/processing).

## What is generative art?

[Generative art](https://www.artnome.com/news/2018/8/8/why-love-generative-art) refers to art that in whole or in part has been programmed using a computer that intentionally introduces randomness as part of its creation process. Generative artists skillfully control both the magnitude and the locations of randomness introduced into the artwork, following the concept of controlled randomness.
